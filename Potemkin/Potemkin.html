                <h2>A giant walking fortress who can turn the match around with his powerful grabs.
                    He is a soldier from the Independent Airborne State of Zepp.
                    
                    He's a proud man with a loyal heart.
                    His stature makes him come off as intimidating, but he's a gentle man who loves nature.
                    He values duty above all, and while he can tolerate his own pain, he cannot bear to see others hurt. He faces adversity head-on.
                    He refuses to be used as a tool to hurt others for evil.</h2>
